# mathcodes.org

**mathcodes.org** is an online platform for solving mathematics problems in a structured, leveled format — inspired by LeetCode, but built for math learners and problem solvers.

## 🌟 Features

- 📚 Python Notebooks on core courses 
- 🧠 A curated library of math problems across topics and difficulty levels
- 💡 Tag-based filtering (e.g., Calculus, Number Theory, Geometry, etc.)
- 🧑‍🎓 User accounts, XP, badges, and solution history
- 🔍 Problem discussions and community insights
- 🏆 Math contests and weekly challenges
- 🧰 Tools for symbolic computation and numerical verification
- 🧵 Open-source and extensible problem format
