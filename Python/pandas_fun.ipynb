    "## What is Pandas?\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas is an open-source data manipulation and analysis library for Python. It provides data structures and functions for working with structured data, such as spreadsheets, SQL tables, and time-series data. Some of its key features include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **DataFrame:** A two-dimensional, size-mutable, and heterogeneous tabular data structure, similar to a spreadsheet or SQL table.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Series:** A one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding data of any type.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Cleaning:** Pandas allows you to clean, transform, and preprocess data efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Analysis:** It provides powerful tools for data analysis, including grouping, aggregation, and statistical analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Visualization:** While Pandas has some basic plotting capabilities, it can be combined with libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn for more advanced visualizations.\n"

    "# Key Data Structures\n",
    "## DataFrame\n",
    "A DataFrame is the primary data structure in Pandas. It is a two-dimensional, size-mutable, and heterogeneous tabular data structure with labeled axes (rows and columns). You can think of it as a spreadsheet or a SQL table.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Series\n",
    "A Series is a one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding data of any type. It is like a single column in a DataFrame. Series can be used to represent a single variable or a single row or column of a DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating DataFrames and Series\n",
    "You can create DataFrames and Series from various data sources, including:\n",
    "\n",

    "- Dictionaries\n",
    "- CSV files\n",
    "- Excel spreadsheets\n",
