# Cauchy's Integral Theorem

One of the most beautiful results in complex analysis:

> If \\( f(z) \\) is analytic on and within a closed curve \\( C \\), then:
>
> \\[
> \oint_C f(z)\,dz = 0
> \\]


This means the integral of a holomorphic function around a closed contour is zero.

### Geometric Meaning

If no singularities lie inside the contour, the integral vanishes.

### Example: \\( f(z) = z^2 \\) around the unit circle

Let \\( C \\) be the unit circle \\( |z| = 1 \\). Then:

$$
\oint_C z^2\,dz = 0
$$

since \\( z^2 \\) is entire (analytic everywhere).
